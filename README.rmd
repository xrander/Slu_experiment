# Sverige LantbruksUniversitet (SLU) Permanent Forest Experiments

![](https://i0.wp.com/odlandestadsbasarer.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SLU-2.jpg?ssl=1)

# Brief Introduction

This is an analysis done as part of the **Sustainable Forestry in Southern Sweden** course in the Euroforester program at the SLU campus at the south of Sweden in [Alnarp](https://www.slu.se/en/departments/southern-swedish-forest-research-centre/).

The data used for this analysis were provided mainly by the research centre at Tonnersjoheden and have been [uploaded here](https://github.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/tree/master/Data).

I will be taking us through the analysis journey. Terms relating to forestry will be explained, while syntax of R used won't be explained. I will also be taking you through the analysis.

**Data Exploration** The package used is the doBy library doBy, dplyr, lattice, ggplot, TukeyC and so on To install the package run the command like this `install.packages('package name')` as an example `install.packages('dplyr')`.

====NB: For most part of the analysis base r packages will be used====

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(doBy)
library(dplyr)
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(TukeyC)
```

# Clone Performance Test - EXP I

The first experiment will be a clone performance experiment. The data used is the 'popdata' which is accessible [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/master/Data/popdata.txt). This analysis will seek to answer the question:
  - Is the treatment having an influence
  - Which clone is performing best

*Importing the data*

```{r eval= TRUE}
pop <- read.table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/master/Data/Lab1/popdata.txt', header = T)
head(pop)
```


**Data description**

-   block: experimental block

-   cutw: cultivar weight

-   height: height of the plant

-   dia = diameter

-   clone: clone class

-   fert: Fertilized or not(1 = fertilized and 3 = control)

We can create a column now and assign the names to the different values.

*Creating a column to give name to the values of the fert*

```{r}
pop$fert_value <- ifelse(pop$fert==1, 'fertilized', 'control')
head(pop)
```

The first step of the analysis is visualize the effect of treatment on diameter and height

**Height diameter relationship of the control and fertilized seedlings**

```{r}
plot(pop$dia, pop$height,
     text(x=01.5,
          y=450,
          labels = "Growth rate of fertilized and unfertilized seedlings",
          col = "red",
          cex = 0.7),
     xlim = c(0,5.5),
     ylim = c(0, 600),
     xlab = 'diameter(mm)',
     ylab = 'Height(mm)',
     main = "Height vs Diameter",
     pch = c(16,17),
     col = c('red', 'blue'))
legend("topleft",
       legend = c("Control","Fertilized"),
       pch= c(16,17),
       col = c('red','blue'))

```
**Index of Slenderness**
The height diameter ratio or index of slenderness is an important measure as it can be used to evaluate a tree stability.
To read more on height diameter relationship click [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/10/1/70/htm#:~:text=Height%2Dto%2Ddiameter%20ratio%20(,of%20tree%20and%20stand%20stability.).
The formula for HDr is given below

$$HD_r = height/diameter$$ Where $$HD_r = height diameter ratio$$

```{r}
pop$hd <- pop$height/pop$dia

```

Given the data we can estimate the average height and diameter for the clones and treatments

```{r}
pop_summary <- summaryBy(height + dia ~ fert + clone, data = pop, FUN=mean)
head(pop_summary)
```

The mean height to diameter of the different treatment as given with the formula above can be estimated.

```{r}
pop_summary$h_d <- pop_summary$height.mean/pop_summary$dia.mean

names(pop_summary)[5] <- 'height_dia_ratio'

barplot(pop_summary$height_dia_ratio,
        names.arg = pop_summary$clone,
        col = pop_summary$fert,
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold('clone'))),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold('height_diameter_ratio'))),
        main = 'Seedling Clone Performance',
        legend = TRUE)
legend('topright',
       legend = c(substitute(paste(bold('fertilized'))),  substitute(paste(bold('control')))),
       col = c('black', 'green'),
       pch = 18)
```

It is evident that the fertilized are performing than the control, with the B clone class being the highest performing either fertilized or not.

# Spacing Experiment of Scotch Pine - Exp II

Numerous experiment have been executed to check the effect of spacing on the productivity of a stand. Without drawing into conclusion and relying on facts from already established truths. I'll explore the to see the effect of spacing on Scotch pine and determine if there are differences between the spacing treatments.

This experiment is a long-term experiment to test the effect of four different spacing treatments 1m, 1.5m, 2m, and 2.5m across eight plots. The experiment is designed such that two plots are assigned a treatment, in this case the plots. The plots are also of varying sizes.

*The Design of the experiment using R*

```{r}
plot = c(11:14, 21:24)
## plot here denotes the plots number or names

areaha = c(0.04, 0.0324, 0.0288, 0.0288, 0.04, 0.0324, 0.0288, 0.0288)
## areaha is the area per hectare of each plots

treatment = c(2.5, 2, 1.5 ,1)
### **nb**: 2.5 implies 2.5*2.5 and 2 implies 2*2 and so on.

### creating the data frame for the plots with their properties
exp1012 <- data.frame(plot, areaha, treatment)
head(exp1012)

```

*importing the data* 
```{r}
### importing data
dbh1012 <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/master/Data/Lab2/dbhlist_exp1012.txt",
           header = T, sep = "\t", na.strings = "NA", dec = ".", strip.white = TRUE)
head(dbh1012)
```

The data used for this analysis can be obtained [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/master/Data/Lab2/dbhlist_exp1012.txt).

**Data Description**

-   plot: the plot number

-   nr: the tree number

-   d1: cross caliper diameter measurement 1

-   d2: cross caliper diameter measurement 2, 90 degrees to measurement 1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analyzing the data

The data will be investigated to see if there's anything strange with the data

```{r}
plot(dbh1012$d1, dbh1012$d2,
     xlab = substitute(paste(bold('d1'))),
     ylab = substitute(paste(bold('d2'))),
     col = c('purple', 'green'),
     pch = c(10,21))
legend('topleft',
       legend = c('d1', 'd2'),
       col = c('purple', 'green'),
       pch = c(10,21))
```

The data seems to be alright, we can now proceed with the analysis


### Basal Area Estimation
Basal area is the average amount of an area occupied by tree stems, defined as the cross-sectional area of all stems in a stand measured at breast height (dbh) and express as per unit of land area.The formula of dbh is 
$$BA = \pi (DBH/2)^2$$
Where:
- BA = Basal area

- DBH = diameter at breast height (1.3m above ground)


```{r}
## average of the two diameter
dbh1012$dm <- (dbh1012$d1 + dbh1012$d2)/2

## squared valued to be used for quadratic mean estimation
dbh1012$dd <- dbh1012$dm^2

## basal area estimation
dbh1012$ba <- pi * ((dbh1012$dm/2)^2)
```

-   dm: mean of both diameter

-   dd: dbh squared

-   ba: basal area

The sum of basal area for each plots can be measured now using doBy's `summaryBy` function and the result merge with `site1012` to have a more robust dataset

```{r}
plotba <-summaryBy(ba~plot, data = dbh1012, FUN = sum)

site1012 <- merge(exp1012, plotba, all = T)

site1012
```
Now we can estimate the basal area per hectare and basal area of each treatments.

```{r}
## Estimating the basal area per hectare
site1012$baha <- (1/site1012$areaha) * site1012$ba.sum

##converting to basal area per hectare from mm2 to m2
site1012$baham2 <- round((site1012$baha/1000000),2)

## Estimating the basal area per treatment
trtmean1012 <- round(summaryBy(baham2~treatment,
                         data = site1012, FUN = mean), 1)
site1012
```

```{r}
barplot(site1012$baham2,
        names.arg = site1012$plot,
        col = c(2,3,4,5),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold('Basal Area (m2/ha)'))),
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold('plot'))),
        main = 'Basal area across sites')
legend('right',
       legend = unique(site1012$treatment),
       pch = 18,
       cex = 1.0,
       col = c(2,3,4,5))
```
* * * * * * *
### Stand Density Estimation
Stand density is a quantitative measurement of a forest. It describes the number of individuals (trees) on a unit area in either absolute or relative terms. To read more on stand density click [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/stand-density#:~:text=Stand%20density%20is%20a%20quantitative,Avery%20and%20Burkhart%2C%201994).)

**Estimating the stand density**
To calculate the density we need some information.
-   The size of the forest: This is usually expressed in ha or m2

-   The size of sample plots: this is important to calculate the total number of plots in the stand.

-   The number of trees in a sample plot or the plot density


```{r}
## To derive the plot density
plotdens <- summaryBy(nr~plot, data = dbh1012, FUN = length)


## we merge the plot density to the site information
site1012 <- merge (site1012, plotdens, all = T)


## After this we can get the density per hectare
site1012$dens_ha <- round((site1012$nr.length * (1/site1012$areaha)), 1)

barplot(site1012$dens_ha,
        names.arg = site1012$plot,
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold("plot"))),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold("density"))),
        main = "Treatment and Density relationship",
        col = c(2,3,4,5))
legend('right',
       legend = unique(site1012$treatment),
       pch = 18,
       cex = 1.0,
       col = c(2,3,4,5))
```
The chart shows there's a marked difference across plots. Plots with the lowest treatment, i.e., spacing have the higher density

### Deriving Arithmetic Mean Diameter(AMD) and Quadratic Mean Diameter(QMD)
The quadratic mean diameter symbolized as QMD is the square root of the summation of the dbh squared of trees divided by the number of trees. 
$$QMD = \sqrt{(\sum d_i^2)/n}$$
Where d = diameter squared
      n = number of trees

QMD is considered more appropriate than AMD (Arithmetic Mean Diameter) for characterizing the group of trees which have been measured. QMD assigns greater weight to larger trees, read more [here](https://www.fs.usda.gov/pnw/olympia/silv/publications/opt/436_CurtisMarshall2000.pdf)

```{r}
plotdbh <- summaryBy(dm+dd~plot, data = dbh1012, FUN = c(mean, sum))

## Merging values to site1012
site1012 <- merge(site1012, plotdbh, all = T)

##Converting dm.mean and dm.sum from millimeters to centimeter
site1012$dm.mean_cm <- site1012$dm.mean/10

site1012$dm.sum_cm <- site1012$dm.sum/10

## "site1012$dm.mean_cm" is synonymous to AMD therefore
site1012$amd = site1012$dm.mean_cm

#converting dd.mean and dd.sum from mm^2 to cm ^2
site1012$dd.mean_cm <- site1012$dd.mean/100

site1012$dd.sum_cm <- site1012$dd.sum/100

#Estimating the Quadratic Mean DIameter
site1012$qmd <- sqrt(site1012$dd.sum/site1012$nr.length)/10

```

### Basal area stand density relationship


```{r}
site1012[,c("baham2", "dens_ha")]
```

we create a new table to hold the amd and qmd. We do this to compare the values using a barplot.
````{r}

amd_qmd <- data.frame(plot = rep(site1012$plot, times = 2),
                      treatment = rep(site1012$treatment, times = 2),
                      diameter = round(c(site1012$amd, site1012$qmd), 1),
                      measures = rep(c('amd', 'qmd'),
                                     each = 8))
amd_qmd
````


```{r}
ggplot(data = amd_qmd, aes(x = as.character(plot), y = diameter, fill = measures)) + 
  geom_bar (position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "QMD and AMD comparison",
       x = substitute(paste(bold('Plots'))),
       y = substitute(paste(bold('Diameter (cm)'))))
```

# Growth Measures

There are various characteristics of a stand that can affect the growth of the stand. Those characteristics include:

    -   species composition

    -   age

    -   site quality

    -   stand density or stocking

    -   competition
    
    -   silvicultural treatment
    
    -   climatic conditions

## Increment
Increment is the increase in growth, diameter, basal area, height, volume, quality or value of individual tree crops during a given period. There are some terminologies and measures associated with tree increment.
    
    -   Yield: this is the usable wood fiber per unit area at a particular age
    
    -   Annual increment
    
  $$G_a = Y_a - Y_{a-1}$$
   
    -   Periodic Annual Increment: This measures the average productivity of the stand over certain period. Can sometimes be referred to CAI if it's between increment between current year and  previous year.
    
  $$ PAI_{a1,a2} = Y_{a2} - Y_{a1} /a_2 -a_1 $$
  
    -   Mean Annual Increment: This measures the average productivity of the stand over its lifetime.
  $$MAI_a = Y_a/a$$
G = growth
Y = Volume for year a
a = year (2 is current and 1 is previous)


We'll try to:

    -   evaluate the volume growth for individual trees

    -   estimate the periodic annual increment (PAI),

    -   estimate the annual or yearly increment and

    -   estimate the plot and treatment volume growth"

To do this we use the tvol1012 data which consists of a revised data from 2 separate years, year 1980 and 1987 will be imported.

*Reading the data*

```{r}
tvol1012 <- read.table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/master/Data/Lab3/tvol1012.txt', header = T, sep = '\t', na.strings = 'NA', dec = '.', strip.white = T)

head(tvol1012)
```
**Estimating the PAI**
```{r}
tvol1012$pai <- (tvol1012$voldm3.1987 - tvol1012$voldm3.1980)/7  # we divide by 7 because that's the difference between 1987 and 1980

#we can estimate the annual increment
tvol1012$ai <- tvol1012$pai/7 #since this is 7 years interval and don't have the value for the immediate previous year, we estimate the average annual increment within that period.
head(tvol1012)
```

Next we sum pai, mean volume for 1980 and 1987 for each plots and merge it with the site information data (site1012)
```{r}
#Estimating plot data for the trees
plotvol <- summaryBy(voldm3.1980 +
            voldm3.1987 +
            pai~plot,
          data = tvol1012, FUN = sum)
a_incrment <- summaryBy(ai~plot, data = tvol1012, FUN = sum)
# Merging data with the data table 'site1012' from RLab2
site1012 <- merge(site1012, plotvol, all = T)
site1012 <- merge(site1012, a_incrment, all = T)

# Evaluating the per hectare values
site1012$volm80ha <- site1012$voldm3.1980.sum/(site1012$areaha*1000)

site1012$volm87ha <- site1012$voldm3.1987.sum/(site1012$areaha*1000)

site1012$paiha <- round(site1012$pai.sum/(areaha*1000), 2)

site1012$ai <- round(site1012$ai.sum/(areaha*1000), 2)
head(site1012)
```

```{r}
pai <- barplot(site1012$paiha,
        names.arg = c(11:14,21:24), 
        main= "Periodic Annual Increment",
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold("plots"))),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold("Volume Per Hectare Per Year"))),
        col = c(8,2,3,4))
legend("bottomright",
         legend = c(2.5,2.0,1.5,1.0),
         pch = 16,
         col =c (8,2,3,4))
text(x = pai, y = site1012$paiha, label = site1012$ai, pos = 3, cex = 0.8, col = 'red')

```
The plot shows the PAI of each plots for the different spacing treatment while showing the annual increment of each plots.


```{r}
#Visualizing the density per hectare
dens <- barplot(site1012$dens_ha, col = c(3,5,8,6),
        names.arg = c(as.character(site1012$plot)), 
        main= "Density per Hectare",
        sub = "4 treatments (2.5,2,1.5,1)",
        ylim = c(0, 4000),
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold("plots"))),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold("Stand Density"))),
        )
legend("topleft",
         legend = c(2.5,2.0,1.5,1.0),
         pch = 16,
         col = c(3,5,8,6))
text (x = dens, y = site1012$dens_ha, label = site1012$dens_ha, pos = 3, cex = 0.7, col = 'Red')
```
### Percentage of Thinnings Removed
We can estimate the percentage of stand removed from thinning operation

```{r}
##first we estimate the density after thinning which is provided in site1012
density <- summaryBy(dens_ha~treatment,
          data = site1012,
          FUN = mean)
 
## dens_ha.mean is the density after thinning, so we rename to 'after_thinning'
names(density)[2] <- 'after_thinning'

##now we estimate the density before thinning
density$before_thinning <- 10000/(density$treatment^2)

##percentage change in the stand can be estimated now.
## percentage change = (old - new)/old *100
density$percent_removed <- (density$before_thinning-
                              density$after_thinning)/density$before_thinning * 100
head(density)
```


### Effect of treatment on  stem density, quadratic mean diameter,and Periodic Annual Increment (PAI)

#### Stem density and treatment(spacing) design effect

```{r}
barplot(tapply(site1012$dens_ha,
               site1012$treatment,
               FUN = mean),
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold('treatment(spacing)'))),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold(('stem density')))),
        main = 'Treatment Effect on Stem Density',
        col = c(5:9))
```
The space is having an effect on the diameter, the smaller the spacing, the greater the stem/stand density

#### Treatment(spacing) effect on QMD
```{r}
barplot(tapply (site1012$qmd,
                site1012$treatment,
                FUN = mean),
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold('treatment(spacing)'))),
        ylim = c(0, 20),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold('mean diameter(qmd)'))),
        main = 'treatment effect on QMD',
        col = c(10:13))
```

Quadratic mean diameter increases with spacing effect according to the bar plot, the effect might diminish if spacing increases

#### Treatment(spacing) effect on Periodic annual increment(PAI)
```{r}
barplot(tapply(site1012$paiha,
               site1012$treatment,
               FUN = mean),
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold("Initial Spacing Treatment"))),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold("PAI, m3/ha & year"))),
        col = c(2,13,15,20),
        ylim = c(0, 20),
        main = "Effect of Spacing on PAI")
