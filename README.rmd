# Sverige LantbruksUniversitet (SLU) Permanent Forest Experiments

![SLU](https://i0.wp.com/odlandestadsbasarer.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SLU-2.jpg?ssl=1)

## Brief Introduction

This is an analysis done as part of the **Sustainable Forestry in Southern Sweden** course in the Euroforester program at the SLU campus at the south of Sweden in [Alnarp](https://www.slu.se/en/departments/southern-swedish-forest-research-centre/).

The data used for this analysis were provided mainly by the research centre at Tonnersjoheden and have been [uploaded here](https://github.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/tree/master/Data).

**Data Exploration**
Package used is the doBy library
To install the package run the command `install.packages('doBy')`
````{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(doBy)
library(dplyr)
````


## Clone Performance Test
The first data used is the 'popdata' which is accessible at [popdata.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/master/Data/popdata.txt)

```{r eval= TRUE}
pop <- read.table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/master/Data/Lab1/popdata.txt', header = T)
head(pop)
```

**Data description**

-   block: experimental block

-   cutw: cultivar width

-   height: height of the plant

-   dia = diameter

-   clone: clone class

-   fert: Fertilized or not(1 = fertilized and 3 = control)

Creating a column to give name to the values of the fert

```{r}
pop$fert_value <- ifelse(pop$fert==1, 'fertilized', 'control')
head(pop)
```

Height diameter relationship of the control and fertilized seedlings

```{r}
plot(pop$dia, pop$height,
     text(x=01.5, y=450,labels = "Growth rate of fertilized and unfertilized seedlings",col = "red", cex = 0.7),
     xlim = c(0,5.5), ylim = c(0, 600),xlab = 'diameter(mm)',
     ylab = 'Height(mm)', main = "Height vs Diameter",
     pch = c(16,17), col = c('red', 'blue'))
legend("topleft",
       legend = c("Control","Fertilized"),
       pch= c(16,17),
       col = c('red','blue'))

```

Deriving the height to diameter ratio

```{r}
pop$hd <- pop$height/pop$dia

```


The mean height and diameter of the control and fertilized of the different clones is given as
````{r}
pop_summary <- summaryBy(height + dia ~ fert + clone, data = pop, FUN=mean)
pop_summary
````
The mean height to diameter of the different treatment  is given as

````{r}
pop_summary$h_d <- pop_summary$height.mean/pop_summary$dia.mean
names(pop_summary)[5] <- 'height_dia_ratio'
barplot(pop_summary$height_dia_ratio,
        names.arg = pop_summary$clone,
        col = pop_summary$fert,
        xlab = 'clone',
        ylab = 'height_diameter_ratio',
        main = 'Seedling Clone Performance',
        legend = TRUE)
legend('topright',
       legend = c('fertilized', b = 'control'),
       col = c('black', 'green'),
       pch = 18)
````
It is evident that the fertilized are performing than the control, with the B clone class being the highest performing either fertilized or not.

## Spacing Effect on Growth on Scot Pine
This is a long term experiment to test the effect of four different spacing treatments 1m, 1.5m, 2m, and 2.5m across eight plots. The experiment is designed such that two plots are assigned a treatment, in this case the plots. The plots are also of varying sizes.

### The Design of the experiment using R
````{r}
plot = c(11:14, 21:24)
## plot here denotes the plots number or names

areaha = c(0.04, 0.0324, 0.0288, 0.0288, 0.04, 0.0324, 0.0288, 0.0288)
## areaha is the area per hectare of each plots

treatment = c(2.5, 2, 1.5 ,1)
### **nb**: 2.5 implies 2.5*2.5 and 2 implies 2*2 and so on.

### creating the data frame for the plots with their properties
exp1012 <- data.frame(plot, areaha, treatment)

### importing data
dbh1012 <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/master/Data/Lab2/dbhlist_exp1012.txt",
           header = T, sep = "\t", na.strings = "NA", dec = ".", strip.white = TRUE)
head(dbh1012)
````

The data used for this analysis can be obtained here [experiment_data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/master/Data/Lab2/dbhlist_exp1012.txt).

**Data Description**

- plot: the plot number

- nr: the tree number measured

- d1: cross caliper diameter measurement 1

- d2: cross caliper diameter measurement 2, 90 degrees to measurement 1

* * * * * * *

### Analyzing the data
The data will be investigated to see if there's anything strange with the data

````{r}
plot(dbh1012$d1, dbh1012$d2,
     xlab = 'd1',
     ylab = 'd2',
     col = c('purple', 'green'),
     pch = c(10,21))
legend('topleft',
       legend = c('d1', 'd2'),
       col = c('purple', 'green'),
       pch = c(10,21))
````
The data seems to be alright, we can now proceed with the analysis

First we estimate the average of the two diameters, we also square the result to get values needed to estimate the quadratic mean then we calculate the basal area
````{r}
## average of the two diameter
dbh1012$dm <- (dbh1012$d1 + dbh1012$d2)/2

## squared valued to be used for quadratic mean estimation
dbh1012$dd <- dbh1012$dm^2

## basal area estimation
dbh1012$ba <- pi * ((dbh1012$dm^2/2)^2)
````

- dm: mean of both diameter

- dd: diameter raised to the power 2

- ba: basal area

The values will be summarized to give a clear value for each plots then combined with the plot characteristics for further analysis

```` {r}
plot_ba <-summaryBy(ba~plot, data = dbh1012, FUN = sum)

site1012 <- merge(exp1012, plot_ba, all = T)

site1012
````
With this table we can estimate the basal area per hectare and the basal area per treatment
