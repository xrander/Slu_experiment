# Growth Measures - Exp III
<br>
Forestry is a long time business that requires patience and careful management. For forest landowners, the tree in the forest is the return in investment, and as businessmen, it is important to track how our investments are performing. Growth measurements are important to telling us how our investments are performing as well as gives insight into how our forest should be managed. Growth measures also gives us information on the optimal time to harvest, as it also shows how the forest performs after tending operation.

There are various characteristics of a stand that can affect the growth of the stand. Those characteristics include:

    -   species composition

    -   age

    -   site quality

    -   stand density or stocking

    -   competition

    -   silvicultural treatment

    -   climatic conditions

## Increment

Increment is the increase in growth, diameter, basal area, height, volume, quality or value of individual tree crops during a given period. There are some terminologies and measures associated with tree increment.

-   Yield: this is the usable wood fiber per unit area at a particular age

-   Annual increment

$$G_a = Y_a - Y_{a-1}$$

-   Periodic Annual Increment: This measures the average productivity of the stand over certain period. Can sometimes be referred to CAI if it's between increment between current year and  previous year.

$$ PAI_{a1,a2} = Y_{a2} - Y_{a1} /a_2 -a_1 $$

-   Mean Annual Increment: This measures the average productivity of the stand over its lifetime.

$$MAI_a = Y_a/a$$ G = growth Y = Volume for year a a = year (2 is current and 1 is previous)

## Questions

We'll try to:

    -   evaluate the volume growth for individual trees

    -   estimate the periodic annual increment (PAI),

    -   estimate the annual or yearly increment and

    -   estimate the plot and treatment volume growth"

To do this we use the tvol1012 data which consists of a revised data from 2 separate years, year 1980 and 1987 will be imported.

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(doBy)
library(dplyr)
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
library(data.table)
library(TukeyC)
```

*Reading the data*

```{r}
tvol1012 <- read.table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/master/Data/Lab3/tvol1012.txt', header = T, sep = '\t', na.strings = 'NA', dec = '.', strip.white = T)

head(tvol1012)
```

**Importing Site Information Data**
```{r}
site1012 <- read.table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/Slu_experiment/master/Data/Lab3/site1012export.txt',
                       header = T,
                       na.strings = 'NA',
                       strip.white = T,
                       dec = '.',
                       sep = '\t')
head(site1012)
```

**Estimating the PAI**

```{r}
tvol1012$pai <- (tvol1012$voldm3.1987 - tvol1012$voldm3.1980)/7  # we divide by 7 because that's the difference between 1987 and 1980

#we can estimate the annual increment
tvol1012$ai <- tvol1012$pai/7 #since this is 7 years interval and don't have the value for the immediate previous year, we estimate the average annual increment within that period.
head(tvol1012)
```

Next we sum pai, mean volume for 1980 and 1987 for each plots and merge it with the site information data (site1012)

```{r}

plotvol <- summaryBy(voldm3.1980 +
            voldm3.1987 +
            pai~plot,
          data = tvol1012, FUN = sum)
a_incrment <- summaryBy(ai~plot, data = tvol1012, FUN = sum)
```
Merging data with the data table 'site1012' from RLab2
```{r}
site1012 <- merge(site1012, plotvol, all = T)
site1012 <- merge(site1012, a_incrment, all = T)
```

Evaluating the per hectare values
```{r}
site1012$volm80ha <- site1012$voldm3.1980.sum/(site1012$areaha *1000)
```

```{r}
site1012$volm87ha <- site1012$voldm3.1987.sum/(site1012$areaha*1000)

site1012$paiha <- round(site1012$pai.sum/(site1012$areaha*1000), 2)

site1012$ai <- round(site1012$ai.sum/(site1012$areaha*1000), 2)
head(site1012)

```

```{r}
pai <- barplot(site1012$paiha,
        names.arg = c(11:14,21:24), 
        main= "Periodic Annual Increment",
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold("plots"))),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold("Volume Per Hectare Per Year"))),
        col = c(8,2,3,4))
legend("bottomright",
         legend = c(2.5,2.0,1.5,1.0),
         pch = 16,
         col =c (8,2,3,4))
text(x = pai, y = site1012$paiha, label = site1012$ai, pos = 3, cex = 0.8, col = 'red')

```

The plot shows the PAI of each plots for the different spacing treatment while showing the annual increment of each plots.

```{r}
#Visualizing the density per hectare
dens <- barplot(site1012$densha, col = c(3,5,8,6),
        names.arg = c(as.character(site1012$plot)), 
        main= "Density per Hectare",
        sub = "4 treatments (2.5,2,1.5,1)",
        ylim = c(0, 4000),
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold("plots"))),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold("Stand Density"))),
        )
legend("topleft",
         legend = c(2.5,2.0,1.5,1.0),
         pch = 16,
         col = c(3,5,8,6))
text (x = dens, y = site1012$dens_ha, label = site1012$dens_ha, pos = 3, cex = 0.7, col = 'Red')
```

### Percentage of Thinnings Removed

We can estimate the percentage of stand removed from thinning operation

```{r}
##first we estimate the density after thinning which is provided in site1012
density <- summaryBy(densha~treatment,
          data = site1012,
          FUN = mean)
 
## dens_ha.mean is the density after thinning, so we rename to 'after_thinning'
names(density)[2] <- 'after_thinning'

##now we estimate the density before thinning
density$before_thinning <- 10000/(density$treatment^2)

##percentage change in the stand can be estimated now.
## percentage change = (old - new)/old *100
density$percent_removed <- (density$before_thinning-
                              density$after_thinning)/density$before_thinning * 100
head(density)
```

### Effect of treatment on stem density, quadratic mean diameter,and Periodic Annual Increment (PAI)

#### Stem density and treatment(spacing) design effect

```{r}
barplot(tapply(site1012$densha,
               site1012$treatment,
               FUN = mean),
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold('treatment(spacing)'))),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold(('stem density')))),
        main = 'Treatment Effect on Stem Density',
        col = c(5:9))
```

The space is having an effect on the diameter, the smaller the spacing, the greater the stem/stand density

#### Treatment(spacing) effect on QMD

```{r}
barplot(tapply (site1012$qmd,
                site1012$treatment,
                FUN = mean),
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold('treatment(spacing)'))),
        ylim = c(0, 20),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold('mean diameter(qmd)'))),
        main = 'treatment effect on QMD',
        col = c(10:13))
```

QMD increases with spacing effect according to the bar plot, the effect might diminish if spacing increases

#### Treatment(spacing) effect on Periodic annual increment(PAI)

```{r}
barplot(tapply(site1012$paiha,
               site1012$treatment,
               FUN = mean),
        xlab = substitute(paste(bold("Initial Spacing Treatment"))),
        ylab = substitute(paste(bold("PAI, m3/ha & year"))),
        col = c(2,13,15,20),
        ylim = c(0, 20),
        main = "Effect of Spacing on PAI")
```
