# Fertilizer Regime Experiment - Exp VI
![](https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/piquenewsmagazine/import/2020-02_news_seatosky2-46e8bfa3e301c696.jpg)
Fertilization of plantations in Sweden is region specific. In the Northern part of Sweden the use of fertilizer is common, while in the Southern region its use is prohibited. The Southern part is having rich soil and have no need to fertilize the soil. Swedish forest fertilization mainly involves the application of Nitrogen which is normally the limiting nutrient for high stand growth.
Different fertilization experiments have been set to either see the effect of different fertilizers on stand development or see the effect of fertilization application frequency on the stand development.

This experiment is set to see the effect of fertilization frequency on the growth of a stand. The experiment is a young Norway Spruce stands which was established with 5 blocks having randomly distributed treatments in 0.1 ha plots. The treatments are with 3 different intensities in fertilization

- F1:   Fertilized every year

- F2:   Fertilized every second year

- F3:   Fertilized every third year

-  C:   Control without Fertilzation.

The amount of nutrients over time was calculated to be more or less the same in F1 F2 and F3.

The experiment was measured initially in year 1972, first measurement revision (revision 1) and there after there were several revisions, but the important revisions are the focus here which is an interval of 5 years period  (rev 1, 4, 5, and 6). This means that the difference between revision 1 and 4 is 15 years, then the addition of the usual 5 years interval.

The volume (m3/ha) and CAI (m3 ha-1yr-1) were calculated for every treatment plot in all blocks.

##Questions

    -   is there a significant effect of treatment compared to control?
    
    -   Do you find a significant difference in between the different treatments, meaning fertilization intensity
    
    -   Do you find any different effect of treatment early on in the experiment compared to later revisions

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(doBy)
library(dplyr)
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
library(data.table)
library(TukeyC)
```

**Importing the data**
```{r}
expfert <- read.table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/SLU-Plantation-Experimentation/master/Data/Lab6/expfert.txt',
           header = T,
           sep = '\t',
           na.strings = 'NA',
           dec = '.',
           strip.white = T)
```

**A Little Data Exploration**
```{r results='hide', message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

str(expfert)
summary(expfert)
```

**To check the number of replications we have in this experiment**
```{r}
ftable(expfert$block, expfert$treatment, expfert$revision)

```

We have 4 revisions and 5 replicates

We can check a quick visual on how the experiment have been measured repeatedly overtime (revisions)
```{r}
xyplot(age~revision|block, data = expfert,
       col = 1,
       pch = 16,
       type= c('p','l'), # to change the plot type, an alternative is using type = 'b'
       strip = strip.custom(bg = 'red'))
```

**Visualizing CAI changes over the revisions**
```{r}
xyplot(CAI~factor(revision)|block,
       groups=treatment,data=expfert,
       par.settings=simpleTheme(col=c(1,2,3,4),pch=c(16,1,2,3)), #adding settings for symbology
       auto.key=list(corner = c(0.02, 0.94),border="black",cex=0.5,points=T))
```
```{r}
xyplot(volume~domheight | treatment,
       group = block,
       data = expfert,
       type = 'b',
       xlab = 'Dominant Height',
       auto.key = list(corner = c(0.02,0.8), border = 'blue', cex = 0.7))
```
## Volume and CAI at the different blocks for the different treatments
### Volume

```{r}
barchart(volume~treatment|block, data = expfert,
         subset = revision == 1,
         main = 'Revision 1',
         ylab = substitute(paste(bold('Volume'))),
         xlab = substitute(paste(bold('Treatment'))))
```

```{r}
barchart(volume~treatment|block, data = expfert,
         subset = revision == 4,
         main = 'Revision 4',
         col = 'purple',
         ylab = substitute(paste(bold('Volume'))),
         xlab = substitute(paste(bold('Treatment'))))
```
```{r}
barchart(volume~treatment|block, data = expfert,

         ylab = substitute(paste(bold('Volume'))),
         xlab = substitute(paste(bold('Treatment'))))
```
```{r}
barchart(volume~treatment|block, data = expfert,
         subset = revision == 6,

         col = 'purple',
         main = 'Revision 4',
         xlab = substitute(paste(bold('treatment'))),
         ylab = substitute(paste(bold('CAI'))))
```

```{r}
barchart(CAI~treatment|block, data = expfert,

bwplot(domheight~treatment, subset=revision==1, data = expfert,
       xlab = substitute(paste(bold('treatment'))),
       ylab = substitute(paste(bold('dominant height (m)'))),
       main = 'dominant height across treatments for revision 1')
```

```{r}
bwplot(domheight~treatment, subset=revision==4, data = expfert,
       xlab = substitute(paste(bold('treatment'))),

## Analysis of Variance to see the effect of the treatments on the volume produced
### Revision of 4
```{r}
M.vol <- lm(volume~block+treatment, 
            data = expfert[expfert$revision==4,])
M.vol
anova(M.vol)
```

#### Posthoc test using Tukeyhsd
```{r}
T.vol <- TukeyC(x = M.vol, which = 'treatment')
summary(T.vol)
```


**Checking for patterns in the residuals with a residual plot**
```{r}
plot(M.vol$fitted.values, M.vol$residuals,
     xlab = 'Fitted Values',
     ylab = 'Residuals')
abline (c(0,0), col = 2)
```
**Getting more information using base r plot function**

```{r}
plot(M.vol)
```

```{r}
M.vol5 <- lm(volume~block+treatment,
             data = expfert[expfert$revision == 5,])

     ylab = 'residuals')
abline(c(0,0), col = 'black')
```

### Revision 6
```{r}
M.vol6 <- lm(volume~block+treatment,
             data = expfert[expfert$revision == 6,])

```


# Fertilization Experiment with Poplar - VI (2)
**Importing the data**
```{r}
poptr<- read.table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/Slu_experiment/master/Data/Lab6/poplartreatment.txt',
           header = T, sep = '\t',
           dec = '.', na.strings = 'NA',
           strip.white = T)
```

This is an extract from the seedling experiment earlier. We'll try to see if there's a significant difference between fertilized and unfertilized seedlings.
**Data Exploration**
```{r}
str(poptr)
```

```{r}
bwplot(volume~treatment, data = poptr,
       xlab = substitute(paste(bold('treatment'))),
       ylab = substitute(paste(bold('volume (m3)'))),
       main = 'Volume distribution for the different treatments')
```
```{r}
bwplot(cutw ~treatment,
       data = poptr,
       xlab = substitute(paste(bold('treatment'))),
       ylab = substitute(paste(bold('colar width (mm)'))),
       main = 'collar width of the different treatments')
```
```{r}
xyplot(volume~cutw, data = poptr,
       group = treatment,
       xlab = substitute(paste(bold('Colar Width (mm)'))),
       ylab = substitute(paste(bold('Volume(m3)'))),
       main = 'collar_width vs volume')
```

## Analysis of Variance
Now we test to see if there are no effect of the treatment on the volume
```{r}
lm(volume~treatment, data = poptr)
```
